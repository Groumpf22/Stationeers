# ---- IC10 Schmitt Trigger ----
# -- Standard - i.e. "cooling"

#When the temperature sensor device reports a value
# higher than TempMax and the valve is not On, the
# valve will turn On.

#When the valve is On, and the sensor device reports
# higher than TempMin, the valve will remain on.

#Once that sensor reports a temperature lower than
# TempMin, the valve will once again shut off and
# this cycle will continue indefinitely:

define TempMax 296.15 #23C
define TempMin 283.15 #10C
